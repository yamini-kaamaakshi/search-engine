    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task."
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "question": "How do neural networks work?",
    "answer": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections and activation functions."
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    "answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn patterns, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Supervised learning includes classification and regression, while unsupervised includes clustering and dimensionality reduction."
  },
  {
    "id": "4",
    "question": "What is deep learning?",
    "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data."
  },
  {
    "id": "5",
    "question": "How does natural language processing work?",
    "answer": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines computational linguistics with machine learning to help computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way."
  },
  {
    "id": "6",
    "question": "What is computer vision?",
    "answer": "Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, including images and videos."
  },
  {
    "id": "7",
    "question": "What are the main types of machine learning algorithms?",
    "answer": "The main types include supervised learning (classification, regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, association), reinforcement learning, and semi-supervised learning."
  },
  {
    "id": "8",
    "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
    "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and random fluctuations, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data."
  },
  {
    "id": "9",
    "question": "What is cross-validation?",
    "answer": "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a machine learning model will generalize to new data by partitioning the data and testing the model on different subsets."
  },
  {
    "id": "10",
    "question": "What is the purpose of feature engineering?",
    "answer": "Feature engineering involves selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to improve machine learning model performance and accuracy."
